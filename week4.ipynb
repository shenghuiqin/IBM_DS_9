    "<p><h4>1.1.1 Background</h4></p>\n",
    "<p>Manhattan, often referred to by residents of the New York City area as the City, is the most densely populated of the five boroughs of New York City, and coextensive with the County of New York, one of the original counties of the U.S. state of New York. Manhattan serves as the city's economic and administrative center, cultural identifier, and historical birthplace. The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island, bounded by the Hudson, East, and Harlem rivers; as well as several small adjacent islands. \n",
    "Brooklyn is also a borough of New York City, coterminous with Kings County, located in the U.S. state of New York. It is the most populous county in the state, the second-most densely populated county in the United States,3 and New York City's most populous borough, with an estimated 2,648,403 residents in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are numerous restaurants spread in the two boroughs, there are new ones opening all the time. Therefore to analyze locations, types, and the number of these restaurants is a plus for those who want to open a new restaurant in the city[1].</p>\n",
    "<p><h4>1.1.2 Problem Description</h4></p>\n",
    "<p> Searching an optimal location to start a new business in the two boroughs can be challenging. One could think that the better location for it should be at a place where there is less competetion. But the problem is that perhaps most of the interested customers instead of going to an isolated neighborhood, prefer to go to a popular neighborhood, where there are more options and there is movement of people. While the concurrence will be big in these regions, the flux of interested customers in this specific region will be relevant as well. Many people, for example, go on the weekends to a specific restaurant and when they arrive, there is a large line waiting for them. This usually happens because it is also a new trend, in some popular restaurants, not to have an option to make a reservation. The good news is that perhaps some of the customers, those who do not want to wait too long in line, might want to search for similar options in the neighborhood. \n",
